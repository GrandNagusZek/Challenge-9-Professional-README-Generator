# Challenge-9-Professional-README-Generator

## Description

- The motivation for this project is the need to be able to dynamically generate a README file for a give project, including a license badge, based on user input.
- This project was built to streamline the process of creating README files for projects. By providing a template and generating content dynamically, it reduces the manual effort required to create and maintain project documentation.
- The project solves the problem of menually creating README files by automating the process. It includes sections such as description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and contact information. The 'renderLicenseBadge' function specifically addresses the inclusion of a license badge based on the chosen license type.
- By building such a project, one can learn about automating documentation processes, handling user input, and creating dynamic content based on that input. Additionally, it provides an opportunity to understand how to integrate badges, like license badges, into README files to convey important information visually.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
